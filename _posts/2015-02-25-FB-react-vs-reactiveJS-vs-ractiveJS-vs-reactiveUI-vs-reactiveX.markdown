What do these things have in common? They sound the same. They are, in fact, different from each other, not competitors. This will not go into all about each but for now this will help answer the question "Which React?"

The main reason for this post is I have seen so so many mention "[ReactiveJS](//twitter.com/reactivejs/status/569619957362888704)" and then they link to "RactiveJS."

+ **[Facebook React](//facebook.github.io/react)** - This one started it all. "React is a JavaScript library created by a collaboration of Facebook and Instagram. Its aim is to allow developers to create fast user interfaces easily."
Here is an intro - [//developer.telerik.com/featured/introduction-to-the-react-javascript-framework](//developer.telerik.com/featured/introduction-to-the-react-javascript-framework)

+ **[ReactiveX (RxJS)](//github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)** - or Reactive Extensions (Rx). "An API for asynchronous programming with observable streams" It's the JS "flavor" of Reactive Extensions which is "is a library to compose asynchronous and event-based programs using observable collections and LINQ-style query operators." [//rx.codeplex.com](//rx.codeplex.com)

+ **[React Native](//reactnative.com)** - Facebook again. "Build native iOS and Android apps with JavaScript" with React..

+ **[ReactiveUI](//github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI)** - For building with the [Xamarin Platform](//xamarin.com). "A framework that integrates with the Reactive Extensions for .NET to create elegant, testable User Interfaces that run on any mobile or desktop platform."

+ **[ReactiveJS](//github.com/mattbaker/Reactive.js)** - There are several that have created a library with the name. None of them have grabbed the domain for it. I give it to this one. It's the first [relevant] google result. "Reactive.js will augment ("reactify") a given Javascript function so that it may track dependencies on other reactive functions. You might think of a reactive function as representing a cell in a spreadsheet..." [//github.com/mattbaker/Reactive.js](//github.com/mattbaker/Reactive.js)

+ **[RactiveJS](//www.ractivejs.org)** - "The Web UI library for perfectionists with deadlines."
Here is a article on React vs Ractive - via Ractive [//blog.ractivejs.org/posts/whats-the-difference-between-react-and-ractive](//blog.ractivejs.org/posts/whats-the-difference-between-react-and-ractive)
