What do these things have in common? They sound the same. Another thing in common is that they are different from each other. It will take some research to find out what each one does for you but at least this will serve to make you ask the question "Which React?"


*	**Facebook react** - [//facebook.github.io/react](//facebook.github.io/react) - This one started it all. "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces."

*	**ractiveJS** - [//www.ractivejs.org](//www.ractivejs.org) - "The Web UI library for perfectionists with deadlines."

*	**reactiveJS** - [//github.com/mattbaker/Reactive.js](//github.com/mattbaker/Reactive.js) - This is a tough on. There are several that have created a library with the name. None of them have grabbed the domain for it. I give it to this one. It's the first [relevant] google result.

*	**reactiveUI** - [//github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI](//github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) - "A MVVM framework that integrates with the Reactive Extensions for .NET to create elegant, testable User Interfaces that run on any mobile or desktop platform."

*	**ReactiveX** (RxJS) - [//reactive-extensions.github.io/RxJS](//reactive-extensions.github.io/RxJS) - or Reactive Extensions (Rx) "An API for asynchronous programming with observable streams"

So there you have it... so far.
