What do these things have in common? They sound the same. Another thing in common is that they are different from each other. It will take some research to find out what each one does for you but at least this will serve to make you ask the question "Which React?"

The main reason for this post is I have seen lots and lots of tweets that mention "ReactiveJS" and then they link to "RactiveJS."


*	**Facebook React** - [//facebook.github.io/react](//facebook.github.io/react) - This one started it all. "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces."
Here is a good intro - [//developer.telerik.com/featured/introduction-to-the-react-javascript-framework](//developer.telerik.com/featured/introduction-to-the-react-javascript-framework)

*	**ReactiveJS** - [//github.com/mattbaker/Reactive.js](//github.com/mattbaker/Reactive.js) - This is a tough on. There are several that have created a library with the name. None of them have grabbed the domain for it. I give it to this one. It's the first [relevant] google result.

*	**RactiveJS** - [//www.ractivejs.org](//www.ractivejs.org) - "The Web UI library for perfectionists with deadlines."
Here is a article on React vs Ractive [//blog.ractivejs.org/posts/whats-the-difference-between-react-and-ractive](//blog.ractivejs.org/posts/whats-the-difference-between-react-and-ractive)

*	**ReactiveUI** - [//github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI](//github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) - "A MVVM framework that integrates with the Reactive Extensions for .NET to create elegant, testable User Interfaces that run on any mobile or desktop platform."

*	**ReactiveX** (RxJS) - [//reactive-extensions.github.io/RxJS](//reactive-extensions.github.io/RxJS) - or Reactive Extensions (Rx) "An API for asynchronous programming with observable streams"
It's the JS "flavor" of Reactive Extensions [//rx.codeplex.com](//rx.codeplex.com)

So there you have it... so far.
