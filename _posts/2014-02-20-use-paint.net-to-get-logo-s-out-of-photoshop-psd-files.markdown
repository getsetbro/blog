1.  Go to [http://www.dotpdn.com/downloads/pdn.html](http://www.dotpdn.com/downloads/pdn.html). Download link is on the right.
2.  Extract from zip and install. Choosing the QUICK install is fine.
3.  If you do not have the needed version of .NET if will notify you. If needed, install that and then paint.NET.
4.  Next download the psdplugin from codeplex [http://psdplugin.codeplex.com/](http://psdplugin.codeplex.com/). This allows opening Photoshop files (.PSD) in paint.NET
5.  Extract the psdplugin files from zip and follow these steps from the Readme.txt:
    1.  Exit all instances of Paint.NET.
    2.  Copy Photoshop.dll into the FileTypes directory such as: "C:\Program Files\Paint.NET\FileTypes"
    3.  Restart Paint.NET, which will automatically detect the plugin.
6.  Open a .PSD file.
7.  Make the "Layers" box taller.
8.  Find the layer with the logo.
    1.  Hopefully it was labeled "Logo" but if not find it by turning off every layer until you see it hide.
    2.  Turn layers on and off by checking / unchecking the checkbox on the right of them.
    3.  Once you find the logo layer leave it turned on.
9.  Turn off all layers that are behind the logo so that you see the workspace checkerboard as the background of the logo.
10.  Select the "Rectangle Select" tool (first one in the tools box) and draw a box around the logo.
11.  Choose "Crop to selection" from the "Image" menu.
12.  Save as a PNG - 32bit. Allow it to "Flatten" before saving.
13.  Done.
