This is an easy way, without needing to learn too much github stuff right away, to quickly get static stuff up online for others to view. I use it for prototyping, spikes, mockups, anything.

In your github repositories click the NEW button:

![example](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5520/14321018403_b02f152efb_o.png)

On this next page give it a name and click CREATE:

![example](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/14114211090_c9e164a376_o.png)

On the created page find and click SETTINGS:

![example](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5510/14298913412_222af0b105_o.png)

On the settings page find and click AUTOMATIC PAGE GENERATOR:

![example](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/14298913362_c932992378_o.png)

On the auto page click CONTINUE TO LAYOUTS:

![example](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3737/14114211210_a472cd39e3_o.png)

On the generated page click PUBLISH (you will be able to make all the changes you need later in your IDE)

![example](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3744/14114299927_d34639889e_o.png)

On the next page CLONE IN DESKTOP, first have installed [GITHUB FOR MAC //mac.github.com](//mac.github.com) or [GITHUB FOR WINDOWS //windows.github.com](//windows.github.com)

![example](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5490/14300276964_39edf37b6c_o.png)

Then choose a folder to save the repo to and click CLONE:

![example](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3669/14114210800_1291d2b080_o.png)

Then I drag the repo folder into SublimeText and make changes. You can delete and add files and folders. GITHUB FOR MAC will track the changes.

![example](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5551/14321017993_f7c9fbd476_o.png)

To upload to github. Go to CHANGES tab of the repo in GITHUB FOR MAC/WINDOWS and click COMMIT AND SYNC.

![example](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2940/14114190638_710f8066bc_o.png)

Real soon your changes will show at your repo pages url like mine [//getsetbro.github.io/newrepo](//getsetbro.github.io/newrepo)
